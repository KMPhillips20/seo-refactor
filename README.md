## Description
In this project we have formed a code to display a webpage that is useful. I had to add semantic elements 
everywhere "div" was to make things more clear to read and understand. I had to change parts of the code 
that was broke and give it an "id" so you could click on the link at the top to go to that body of the page. I added some text 
decoration at the top to under line seo, so when hovered over it will give you a understanding of what seo stands for. 
I added a title to the page so when on the page it will show up in the tab. In the style.css I condinced some lines into one class so things weren't repeating themselves. This happened in the "benefit h3" section and also the "content h2" section. I also did the same thing for ".content img" section, they were repeating the same steps so I just put them all in to one class instead of having 30 lines of the same information showing.
